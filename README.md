Props to [caseywatts](http://github.com/caseywatts) for most of inhaler.js. I only had to make some tweaks to get this working.

## How to Use

1. `git clone` the repo like normal
2. "load unpacked extension" into chrome. The `unpacked extension` is the folder that contains this entire repo - see [google's docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked]) for details.
3. Ta-da! Currently it'll run on any slack emoji edit page automatically every time. (PR a `browseraction` toggle for us if you want? ;D)
