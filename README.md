Your favorite emoji are in one Slack but not another? Download them all and re-uploading them all could take a whiiiile.

This chrome extension automates the downloading half of it :)


## How to Use

1. `git clone` the repo like normal
2. In `chrome://extensions` do `load unpacked extension` into chrome. The `unpacked extension` is the folder that contains this entire repo - see [google's docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked]) for details.
3. Ta-da! Go to a slack emoji edit page, and then press the extension's icon (bubbles!). All of the emoji on that page will be downloaded, and it could take a while.
